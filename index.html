      <h3>Why AltBeacon?</h3>
      <p>
        Because there is no open and interoperable specification for proximity beacons, <a
        href="http://radiusnetworks.com">Radius Networks</a> has authored the AltBeacon
        specification as a proposal for how to solve this problem.
      <p>
        We firmly believe that an open specification would help everyone, and we
        want to do it right. This is simply the proposal, now we would like feedback from the community.

      <h3>What is AltBeacon?</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        AltBeacon is a specification that defines the format of the 
        advertisement message that Bluetooth Low Energy proximity beacons
        broadcast.
        </li>
        <li>
        The AltBeacon specification is intended to create an open,
        competitive market for proximity beacon implementations.
        </li>
        <li>
        The AltBeacon specification is free for all to implement, with no
        royalty or fees.
        </li>
        <li>
        AltBeacon does not favor one vendor over another for any
        reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor's
        implementation.
        </li>
