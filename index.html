      <h3>Why AltBeacon?</h3>
      <p>
      Currently there is no good open and interoperable specification for
      working with proximity beacons across platforms and devices. <a
        href="http://radiusnetworks.com">Radius Networks</a> saw this need
      and has worked to author an open specification.
      </p>
      <p>
      We firmly believe that an open specification would help everyone, and
      want to do it right. This is the proposal, we would like feedback from
      the community

      <h3>What is AltBeacon?</h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        The AltBeacon specification is intended to create a fair,
        competitive market for implementations of the specification. They
        do not lock the customer into a particular vendor or group.
        </li>
        <li>
        The AltBeacon specification is free for all to implement, with no
        royalty or fee.
        </li>
        <li>
        AltBeacon does not favor one implementor over another for any
        reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor's
        implementation.
